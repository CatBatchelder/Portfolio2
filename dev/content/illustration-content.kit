        <h3 class="description-text">It is always enjoyable to have some fun when it comes to illustrations. Below are two different robots, Bob and Frank. Bob is a pure illustrative piece that has a unique dashboard, like a console, that allows him to be creative compared to his counterparts. Frank is a combination of unwanted parts. Photographed and pieced together to create a unique never before the seen robot.</h3>

        <h3 class="description-text">Within design there are a lot of exercises that focus on looking at yourself and using yourself as the pure model for your works. In this self-portrait, I discovered the intricacy of color. You may think something is one shade but, this doesnâ€™t always tend to make something look realistic. </h3>
