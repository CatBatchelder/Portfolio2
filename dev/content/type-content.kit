        <h3 class="description-text">Following the same story as the static version, this animated version of the story Miracles by Lucy Corin follows the idea of a spider making a web and the slow evolution into denigration. I wanted to highlight the idea of separation and disappearance/ death with the animated version. </h3>

        <h2 class="sub-text">Miracles Static Trifold</h2>

        <h3 class="description-text">Miracles is a short story written by Lucy Corin. It follows the the memory of the narrator, their brother, and their father hatching black widow eggs out of a jar back on their old farm. Watching the release of the siders out of the jar, they are spraying the spiders with hairspray, killing them as soon as they are able to be released. Their mother is not in the picture which is highlighting the contrast of the separation of their spiders from their parents with their own family situation. In addition this short story highlights this idea of life and death. This piece starts sporadically, similar to Corin’s other works, and has not one purpose. I highlighted this idea of life versus health the the gradual change from white to black. The hourglass shape is resembling the hourglass on the body of a black widow and the gradual time running out. The purpose of this piece is not to be legible but rather convey the message of the work. Click the images below to see the process sketches of the static and animated versions.</h3>

        <h3 class="description-text">Dimitri Shostakovich composed Symphony No. 5 in D Minor, Opus 47 in July of 1937. This piece is a reposed to just criticism and it follows the journey of the society until the finale which is a satirical picture of a dictator. This piece is in the colors of the soviets posters during that period. In addition, some elements follow the structure of the Soviets posters such as the type lockups, shapes, and emphasis. Shostakovich’s name is hiding behind the 5 to resemble his constant struggle with the Soviet government and how he would hide behind his music.

        <h3 class="description-text">Caslon is a typeface that was created by William Caslon in 1722. He used influences from Dutch baroque fonts and British Georgian architecture during the time. Caslon was a gunlock and barrel engraver before making his way into type. I wanted to incorporate this when creating the design and type lockups. Before creating Caslon, William designed an English Arabic typeface which had a large influence on his typeface Caslon, especially in the serifs. I tried to mimic elements of this with the connection of the R and the T that look as if they could create a new letterform. </h3>

I created a series of lecture posters for experts on global warming coming to speak to Drexel students. My idea behind the lockup on the left is to create an overall sense of sparse and fading. This is mimicked with the paragraph gradually falling into a smaller text and harder to read. Note: this is a mock-up lecture series, it did not actually happen</h3>
