        <h2 class="sub-text">VW Beetle Dashboard Redesign</h2>

        <h3 class="description-text">Beetles are iconic cars and will forever be known for their 60s charm. I drive a VW beetle and know first hand their quant iconic nature and created a startup dashboard animation to convey their full personality. This design follows true to the iconic 60’s colors and the charm of the beetle including a flower for the GPS tracker alluding to their flower holder that is seen within the older models (sadly not in the newer models.) The loading screen pays tribute to the older generations as it drives in revealing the temperature and morphs to the newer models to reveal the time. The shape of the speedometer comes directly from the iconic curve of the roof of the beetle. The personality of their car is seen within a variety of elements of the dashboard. The animation is coded, for ease of viewing it is displayed below as a mp4.  </h3>

        <h3 class="description-text">As being a native of Annapolis, Maryland, boat shows were something I frequented. As my first website building and design project, I wanted to rebrand the website for this show as they did not truly have one. Something I enjoyed creating with this design concept was the gradient to look like the further you scroll the deeper in the water you would get. Also, I added the decoration of the bubbles that look like air bubbles in the water.</h3>
