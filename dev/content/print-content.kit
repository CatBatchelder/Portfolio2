        <h3 class="description-text">In the midst of Covid-19 I think everyone had the desire to travel. Traveling is one of my passions and I wanted to create a magazine to exhibit that. The main concept of this magazine is to find the best locations in a country to take photos and the cover inhibits that idea with the atheistic of a polaroid. I wanted to make this magazine personal to me therefore the I of the masthead is a pin from my never-ending pin collection. The stamps for every cover will change according to the location that issue is covering. The last page is a possible cover for the Brazil issue. </h3>

        <h3 class="description-text">Being from Annapolis I knew that I had to create something that would capture the full essence of the beautiful city. I created a travel poster, postcard, and stamp that would be used to draw tourists in. Pictured are a few different key elements: the sailboat, capital building, and the blue crap. Annapolis is known as the sailing capital of the east coast with its iconic location amongst the Chesapeake Bay. Maryland is known for their blue crabs and I made sure to add it in a quirky way.</h3>
