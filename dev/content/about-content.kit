    <h1>MY STORY</h1>
    <p class="content-text">My story of getting to Graphic Design is quite a unique journey. My first creative passion was dance; I danced competitively for over 12 years growing up until I had a bad accident and had to stop. Needing a way to let out all the creative ideas flowing in my head, I took art classes at my high school. I began looking into what career paths I could take within a creative field. I soon found graphic design and took a summer class at Maryland Institute College of Art and fell in love with the craft. I would constantly find myself in the studio for hours and hours past when everyone left. That's when I found out graphic design is my passion. Flash forward four years, I have my B.S. in graphic design and am still eager to learn more about the beautiful craft.  </p>
