    <h1>MY STORY</h1>
    <p class="content-text">The story of getting to Graphic Design is quite a unique journey. My first creative passion was dance; I danced competitively for over 12 years growing up until I had a bad accident and had to stop. Needing a way to let out all the creative ideas flowing in my head, I had to take art classes at my high school. I began looking into what career paths I could take within a creative field. I soon found graphic design and took a summer class at Maryland Institute College of Art and fell in love with the craft. I would constantly find myself in the studio for hours and hours past when everyone else left. That's when I found out graphic design is my passion. </p>
